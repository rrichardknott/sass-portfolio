            After having spent nearly 20 years in the public sector arena as an
            Human Resources Professional,, I am now finally able to pursue my
            dream of working as a web-developer. C# is my main programming
            language and .Net is the framework. Other technologies I work with
            are HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Entity Framework, SQL,
            Sass along with Git/Github, Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio,
            and even WordPress ðŸ˜ƒ.

            During my time at Coder Foundry I built full ASP.Net applications
            with user authentication, enhanced roles & security, code-first
            relational database design, and snuck in some Sweet-Alert too! I
            spent hundreds of hours coding, debugging, and designing in Visual
            Studio 2019. It was an extremely challenging time but I loved it
            all.

            The City of Chino is the best City to work for in Southern

            working for Chino Police Department. From the Chief on down there
            are great people who work hard to uphold justice and peace. From
            performing recruitments to investigations and everything in between,
            my time at the City was very interesting, fun, and help shape my
            view of public sector work.
